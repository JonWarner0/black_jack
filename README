Black Jack and Q-learning Agent:

Agent learns from comparing bust probabilities and past actions
to determine the move that will most likely yield a win.

Tested on:
        python versin 3.7.6
	MySQL 8.0.20

- The game does NOT yet support spliting of cards or doubling down.

- Other palyers cards are not known to other players for probability simplicity
 (will change once the correct equation is made). Once up and running other players
 cards will be taken into acount.

- Start with a single deck for probability simplicity and one game per episode. Once completed, 
 deck size will move to a 6 decks with 6 games played per episode with no more than 5 players
 (minus dealer) to prevent skewing of probabilities.

- The database is cleared at the start it is not yet officialy being used meaningfully.

To run game in terminal:
> python blackjack.py {your MySQL psswrd} {name1} {name2} ...
